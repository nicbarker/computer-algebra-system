# SimpleCAS (Computer Algebra System)
This is a reference implementation of a simple [Computer Algebra System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system). It allows you to manipulate algebraic equations in a mathematically consistent manner, using operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponential, root, etc.

https://algebrasandbox.com provides an interactive look at how the library can be used. The code itself is currently provided in C# in the [Algebra.cs](https://github.com/nicbarker/computer-algebra-system/blob/main/csharp/Algebra.cs) file. I'll likely provide a TypeScript and Rust implementation, but feel free to contribute a port to another language if you like.
